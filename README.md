# Project: Video Encoder for Black-and-White Images

This project functions as a video encoder specifically designed to convert black-and-white images into video format and vice versa. By translating each pixel's color into binary code—where black is represented as 1 and white as 0—it enables the efficient encoding of visual information into videos. The process also allows for the decoding of videos back into their original black-and-white images.

## Key Features
- **Video Encoding for Black-and-White Images:** Converts each pixel into binary values, creating a video representation of the image.
- **Video Decoding to Black-and-White Images:** Transforms binary values back into original black-and-white images.
- **Efficient Data Processing:** Utilizes optimized algorithms for quick and accurate encoding and decoding.

## Usage
1. Load the black-and-white image you wish to encode.
2. Execute the encoding process to generate a video.
3. To decode, load the video and retrieve the original black-and-white image.
